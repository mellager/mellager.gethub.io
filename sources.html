      This site provided all the information I needed to learn about The Impossible
      Project, a company that purchased the last Polaroid Company. Upon purchasing
      it, they realized there were no instructions on how to make the film or the
      Polaroid cameras, so the company immediately got to work on reinventing the
      process. Within a year they were successful and were helping bring back the
      Polaroid Camera.

      This site taught me about how ZINK, or zero ink technology works. This technology
      is what made Polaroid’s digital PoGo camera possible, as well as their portable
      printer. The process is very similar to that of the classic film with the reaction
      taking place in the film itself.

    <p>"Polaroid." Polaroid. N.p., 2014. Web. 05 Nov. 2016. <br>
      This was by far the most helpful site. They had a timeline of the company which
      I found extremely useful up until about 1999, when the timeline stops for 9 years.
      These were the years in which the company went bankrupt. This site was also
      helpful in showing me what Polaroid has done in recent times.

    <p>Zhang, Michael. "Casio QV-10: The First Digital Camera That Offered an LCD Screen
      and Live View." PetaPixel. N.p., 05 Sept. 2012. Web. 06 Nov. 2016. <br>
      I wanted to try to pinpoint the exact moment in history that sent the Polaroid Camera
      into obsolescence and found my answer on this site. This page gave helpful information
      on the first digital camera with an LCD screen. Now, while people couldn’t hold their
      picture right after they took it, they could see it, and retake it if necessary.
