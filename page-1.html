    <p>The Polaroid Camera was first invented in 1948 by Edwin Land. The futuristic
    technology immediately took off and by 1977, with the invention of the OneStep
    Land camera, the Polaroid became the most widely used camera in the world.
    With the invention of the Digital Camera, Polaroid started to become obsolete.
    By 2001 the company was bankrupt. 7 years passed in which the digital camera
    reigned supreme, but in 2008, Polaroid made a comeback, reinventing the instant
    photo method and introducing ZINK, or zero ink technology. Soon, the polaroid
    camera was back, both internally in the company and through other companies,
    including The Impossible Project and Fuji Film.

    <p>The Polaroid Camera gives people everything they crave today: instant
    gratification--they can hold what they captured immediately after taking it,
    a physical memory they can share directly with others, and a way to tap into
    the feeling of nostalgia everyone is experiencing in recent years.
