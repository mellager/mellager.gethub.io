    <h5>Bastille - Eye of the Stormers</h5>

      <a href="https://spotify---bastille.appspot.com/" target="_blank">
      <img src="images/screenshotbastille.jpg" alt="Bastille Webpage" height="360" width="567"></a>

    <p>I immediately felt that the hierarchy was well prioritized,
    as the large, centered word “BASTILLE” was the reason for me
    clicking on and using this site for my first blog post. Titled,
    “Bastille: Eye Of The Stormers (appropriately named after the
    band’s fanbase), the first page is extremely simple—it provides
    a clear focus (Bastille), links to Spotify (the company who
    created the website) and a quick and easy way to stream the band’s
    new album. Most importantly, centered beneath the title, there is
    a link to the interactive site. As soon as you enter the site, it
    also greats you with a new song from their album, apparently
    chosen at random.
    </p>

    <p>The visuals in the background are extremely beautiful,
    reminiscent of a fire with embers floating into the night.
    Another subtle but extremely satisfying detail found in the
    background is the interactivity. As you move the mouse around
    the page, the embers or dust particles are pushed around as if
    your cursor is blowing them away.
    </p>

    <p>The colors are visually pleasing and fit perfectly with their
    first album, Bad Blood which was predominantly brown with various
    shades of gold. Their new album (which the promotion of, I assume,
    is the reason behind the site) has many browns and gold tones however
    also a large amount of blue and grey. To make the website feel like
    it is more for their latest release, using more blue/grey would have
    been a good idea.
    </p>

    <p>Upon clicking on the main link and entering further into the site,
    I found that they did indeed feature a blue/grey tone. On the left
    hand side of the site page there is a list of statistics featuring
    major cities around the world and the number of times each city has
    listened to the album ordered from highest number of streams to the
    lowest. The city furthest down on the list is featured in the blue
    grey color previously mentioned. This brings up yet another issue I
    have with the site. The blue really pops out against the other colors
    used on the site, however they use it to highlight the cities that are
    lowest on the list. It would have been much more successful if they use
    the bright blue to direct attention to the cities who have streamed the
    album the most.
    </p>

    <p>Being that I am a big Bastille fan, I knew that these colors matched
    the band’s aesthetic and color theme well; however for someone who is
    not familiar with the band, they might find the colors to give the
    website and features a polluted and dirty feel. Especially when actually
    entering the site and being presented with a interactive,
    three-dimensional globe, the brown and dusty look make the earth appear
    polluted.
    </p>

    <p>The interactive earth is a fantastic visual that really hooked me
    into the site. The user is able to click and hold the earth and discover
    storms varying in size, representing the cities who have listened to the
    album the most, and thus, brought on a large “storm” over their city.

    <h5>Coffee Roaster Page Assignment</h5>

      <a href="https://mellager.github.io/coffee-shop.html">
        <img src="images/coffeescreenshot.jpg" alt="Coffee Shop Webpage" height="360" width="567"></a>

    <p>I was excited to find that as we made our way through the Coffee Shop
    website exercise as a class, I was understanding each and every code we
    put into place. It seems to me that in order to be a coder, one important
    aspect is to remember elements and their assets, and remember the order
    to place everything. Once I completed the Coffee Shop home page without
    any bumps, we were told to then create the "Our Roasters'' page on our
    own. Although I had found the Coffee Shop page to be fairly easy, I
    suddenly believed the ease to have been due to the fact that we were all
    following the lead of my professor. I felt there was no way I could do
    it on my own.
    </p>

    <p>I quickly discovered that would not be the case. As soon as I started
    typing <!DOCTYPE HTML>, all the other code started coming back to me and
    I quickly finished the basic html code. Once I got the the CSS, I got a
    little worried again. I slowly began typing the CSS, but before I got
    too far, realized something that would save me a lot of time: the CSS
    for the "Our Roasters" page was the same as the CSS for the home page.
    I quickly copied and pasted the CSS link and finalized the page by adding
    the appropriate picture tag, and was finished. I was super excited about
    the whole ordeal (no sarcasm).

    <h5>A List Apart: "Why Aren't You Asking Questions?"</h5>

    <p>I was immediately excited when I saw the title of this article. “Why
    Aren’t You Asking Questions?” This is, of course, in regards to asking
    your client questions as a designer. Recently, over the summer, I was
    commissioned by a band in the United Kingdom to create two gig posters
    for their upcoming shows. I immediately said yes, and was blinded by my
    excitement of even being asked, and forgot to ask any questions. Needless
    to say, this led to a rocky process, and I experienced months of redesign
    that would have been otherwise unnecessary had I asked QUESTIONS!
    </p>

    <p>That tip in itself would have helped me greatly in that process; however
    this article goes into even more depth, clarifying everything from important
    questions to ask, and addressing who to ask. I found that it is not only
    good to ask questions, it is good to have an ongoing dialogue with the
    client, to keep them updated on the process, and so they can update you on
    what they want changed in real time.
    </p>

    <p>Asking about the “end user’s needs” is also an important question to as
    in the very beginning of the process. Once you have this list it is
    important to continually refer to it as you create your design.
    </p>

    <p>One of the most interesting and helpful sections in the article was
    titled “Establish attainable business goals”. In this section, the author
    addresses the fact that business goals can be “lofty” and “interpreted into
    almost anything”, often being “difficult to measure” (Gervais, n.p.). The
    author suggests using a goal template:
We want to ____________ because ______________ so that ____________.
    </p>

    <p>One other important aspect that I felt is something I need to grasp
    before going into the design world is accepting I’m going to annoy someone.
    During my poster creating process, there were moments where I thought of a
    question, but didn’t want to bug the guys I was making the poster for. (I
    am way too shy when it comes to communicating with people in general.) In
    the long run, annoying someone and asking tons of questions will result in
    a design that the client truly wants. This is much better than tip-toeing
    around important questions as to not bug the client, then showing a
    finalized piece that they don’t even want or that doesn’t properly fit their
    needs. I eventually got to the exact poster the band was looking for,
    however not until after I changed a million things including positioning
    and color, resized multiple posters, messed up the quality, fixed the
    quality, and abut a million other things. Had I read this article before
    jumping into my first design job, I might have finished in a week as opposed
    to a month.

    <h5>Responsive Site: Sasquatch</h5>
      <a href="http://sasquatchfestival.com/">
        <img src="images/squatch-desktop.jpg" height="340" width="621" alt="Desktop View"/></a>

    <p>I decided to look at the website for Sasquatch Music Festival, both because
      I’ve been to that festival and have seen and enjoyed their design choices and
      wanted to see how they translate onto a website, and because this was the most
      colorful sight on the list and it caught my eye. As for the overall design of
      the sight, I found it completely and accurately represented the festival, with
      its vibrant colors and unique headline fonts. Each category of the nav was
      displayed in a fixed bar at the top of the page and used extremely legible and
      clear fonts. Organizationally speaking, I felt the site prioritized well. Most
      of the sections were stacked and took up the entire page with a beautiful
      high-quality but quick-loading image as the background. The first section was a
      simple “Thank You” and reminder that next years festival would again be taking
      place on Memorial weekend. This was followed with a section containing only one
      button which led to a page providing all the festival information. The site
      provides many different ways to do one thing, for instance, if you want to buy
      tickets you can:
    </p>

      <p>1. Click the "Buy Tickets" tab in the nav.<br>
      2. Hover over the Festival Info tab and click "Ticketing Info".<br>
      3. Click the "Festival Info" button beneath the "Thank You" section.<br>
      4. Or scroll all the way down and click the "Tickets and Pricing" button.</p>

    <p>Overall the desktop website is very useable, spread out but not boring, and
      extremely easy to use as they have provided multiple ways to get to whatever
      you’re looking for.
    </p>

    <a href="http://sasquatchfestival.com/">
      <img src="images/squatch-mobile.jpg" height="370" width="212" alt="Mobile View"/></a>

      <a href="http://sasquatchfestival.com/">
        <img src="images/squatch-menu.jpg" height="370" width="212" alt="Menu on Mobile View"/></a>

    <p>Switching to the mobile view not too much had to change for it to continue
      to operate perfectly. The most notable change is the nav bar, which gets
      compressed into a three-lined drop down menu. As soon as you click that a
      bright orange menu pops up providing all the same links. On the desktop view,
      the web designers made sure to size the background images in such a way that
      they take up the entire page perfectly. On mobile you can see the thank you
      page and the “Festival Info” button page at the same time. I think it might
      have been more successful if they could have made the two pages separate on
      mobile too, because the two pictures together make the page feel a bit more
      cluttered. Being that it is already being shrunk onto a smaller screen, the
      designers might want to take that into consideration.
    </p>

    <p>The iPad view is a perfect balance between the desktop and mobile view. The
      pictures don’t quite fit the screen perfectly again, but with the iPad,
      users get the full nav bar back, again in a helpful fixed position.
    </p>

    <p>When I started to move around the size of the page, I noticed when the width
      became larger than about 700px, the nav bar would automatically switch to a
      compressed drop down menu. I am curious to know if this is a standard amount
      to set a website to switch at, or if it is up for the web designer to decide.
      I am also curious to learn how to set that in HTML and CSS.
    </p>
