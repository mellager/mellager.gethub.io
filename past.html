    <p>Since the early 1800s, the process of taking and developing photographs
      was a long one. A person would have to load the camera with film, use the
      film, then take it to a dark room and develop it using a variety of different
      chemicals, for various amounts of time. For over 100 years this was the only
      process of obtaining a photograph. Come 1923, a man named Samuel Shlafrock
      had the idea to include a miniature portable dark room with a film camera.
      Although this process never took off due to the difficulty of carrying around
      loose chemicals with an already bulky camera, it got people thinking about
      cameras that could instantly develop film.
    </p>

    <p>Just over 20 years later, in 1948, a man named Edwin Land was out taking
      pictures of his daughter. Amid the picture-taking, the three-year-old asked
      her father why she is unable to view the photographs as he takes them. It was
      at this moment that Edwin Land thought up the idea of an instant camera.
    </p>

    <p>At the time, Land, an ex-Harvard physics student who owned his own company,
      Land-Wheelwright Laboratories, along side his old physics professor, had an
      extensive background in the development of synthetic polarizers. Prior to the
      development of the polaroid camera, “the company [produced] glasses, ski
      goggles, 3D glasses, and dark-adapter goggles for the Army and Navy”
      (“Polaroid” n.p.). By February of 1947, Land created a working prototype, which
      he displayed at the Optical Society of America meeting, immediately captivating
      the audience with the futuristic invention. A year later, the first camera was
      purchased for $89.95, or about $974.00 today. Land’s company, now called
      Polaroid and no longer focusing on research but on technology development,
      began mass producing their cameras worldwide. Now people could take high quality,
      black and white photographs, and immediately hold the photo in their hands
      moments later, all due to a genius method developed by Edwin Land. The method
      changed slightly less than 10 years later when Land developed a color polaroid
      and released it to the public.

    <p>The process through which a polaroid camera works is similar to that of a
      regular film camera, the key difference being that the polaroid camera is
      loaded with a two-in-one type of film—film that acts as both the film and
      the paper on which the photo will be printed. When the user presses the shutter
      release or capture button, the camera slides a negative film sheet in front of
      the camera lens, and the shutter opens, capturing the image on the sheet.
    </p>

    <img src="images/shutter.png" height="202" width="455" alt="Shutters"/>

    <p>Inside the film sheet are three layers of silver chemicals: a red layer to
      capture red light, a green layer to capture green light, and a blue layer to
      capture blue light. Separated from the silver chemicals is another
      reaction-inducing chemical contained in the white boarder (it’s not just for
      writing captions on the photograph!). As the camera pushes the picture out,
      rollers squeeze the reagent chemicals into the center of the sheet, and the
      reaction begins, developing the photograph right before the user’s eyes.
