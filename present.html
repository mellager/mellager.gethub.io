    <p>in 2008 a new company, under new management, yet with the same name emerged
      with a new Polaroid digital camera. The Polaroid PoGo camera no longer used
      the silver, multi-layered sheets of film, and instead used a new technology
      known as ZINK, or zero ink. The technology still uses three layers of colored
      sheets, this time cyan, yellow, and magenta, and this time the reagent is simply
      the sun. The rest of the process is exactly the sameâ€”the shutter opens with the
      negative in place to receive light, the paper reacts to the light, and the image
      begins to appear on the sheet.

    <p>Many other companies, including The Impossible Project made their own attempts
      at bring back the instant camera. The aformentioned company purchased the last
      polaroid factory and developed a way to make the classic film and cameras again.
      Companies like Fugi Film saw the increase in popularity of the instant camera,
      and thus developed their own line: Instax Mini and Wide.

    <p>Using the same technology ~ZINK~ Polaroid developed a way to turn your
      phone into an instant camera. The portable wireless printer became possible
      when the need for large and expensive ink cartridges became unecessary.
